Please refer to this [plugin's website](https://daleghent.com/utilities-for-astro-physics-mounts) for detailed documentation. I also maintain a [website with tips](https://daleghent.com/nina-and-astro-physics-mounts) on using NINA with Astro-Physics mounts.

# Requirements #

* NINA 1.11
* APCC Pro 1.9 or APCC Standard 1.8 (APCC Pro is required for the use of APPM)
* The **Enable Server** setting is **On** in NINA's options (refer to Options > General)

# Provided functions #

* Start APCC
    * Starts APCC and connects NINA to the Astro-Physics ASCOM driver. Assumes that APCC's **Auto-Connect** setting is selected in both the **Mount** and **AP V2 Driver** option areas in the Setup tab
* Create APPM Model
    * A sequence instruction that will run Astro-Physics Point Mapper (APPM) in an automated mode. When ran, APPM will use its existing default settings to run a point mapping session and will load the results into APCC Pro when complete. If the default settings and point map are not desired, an APPM settings or a point map file may be optionally specified below in this plugin's settings.
